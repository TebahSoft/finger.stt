About the Input device, we live in the TOUCH era.

![Input Device Trends](https://github.com/TebahSoft/finger.stt/blob/main/Input%20Device%20Trends.gif?raw=true)

So, many SW want to use voice input functions for inputting user's requests.

## This Open Source program helps you to choose the right STT engine.

1) Common data structure for various STT engines (Azure, Google, NAVER, etc.).
2) The editor to correct STT engine's errors.


## 1. Common data structure

There are many STT engines.
Unfortunately, they have diffent data structure to use it.
Because each engine has the unique advantage for the specific area, developer should use them appropriately.

In this open source, we use the common structure for the varous STT engines.
It means that you adjusts a few source codes in this repository to use the other STT engines.

## 2. STT sample

You can create simple SW using voice recognition technique.
